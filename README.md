# puni-test

This repository contains a simple Pyxel-based invader game written with the
Pyxel library.  Use the arrow keys to move the player at the bottom of the
screen and press the space bar to shoot upward.  Protect yourself with the
barriers, avoid enemy fire and try to shoot down the occasional UFO for bonus
points.  If all lives are lost or the invaders reach the bottom of the screen
the game ends.  Press the return key to start a new round.

Install the Pyxel library first:

```bash
pip install pyxel
```

Run the game with:

```bash
python invader.py
```
